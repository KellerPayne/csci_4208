        <p>You wake up in your assigned cryopod. You feel a warm breeze brush against your cheek as your senses slowly start to come back to you.</p>
        <p>As you open your eyes, everything is blurry.</p>
        <p>Just then, you hear alarms blaring.</p>
        <p>You blink your eyes quickly to remove the sleep from them as you yank out the IV that had been providing you with vital nutrients to keep you alive before you jump out of your pod to respond to the alarms.</p>
        <p>As you enter the cockpit, you notice the autopilot screen is glitching and you see an asteroid suspiciously close to your ship.</p>
