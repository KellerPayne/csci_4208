        <p>You assess the damage to your ship. It looks like there is a fire in the comms module. You will need to put that out before it becomes too damaged.</p>
        <p>There also appears to be a fire in the Secondary Cryo Module. You need to put that out to save the remaining crew members onboard.</p>
        <p>There is also a fire in the Habitat module. If you don't put that out, you and your crew will not have shelter when you arrive to your destination.</p>
        <h4>You need to gather your emergency supplies before proceeding.</h4>
