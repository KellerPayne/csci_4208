       <h1>Comms Module Entrance</h1>
       <hr> 
       <img src="assets/doorClosed.jpg" width="480">
       <p>You approach the Comms Module door. You can't tell how bad the damage is yet.</p>
       <p>You place your hand on the biometric scanner to open the door.</p>
       <p>As the door opens, you are relieved to see that the module is mostly intact. There is a small fire coming out of one of the backup power
            panels that you were able to extinguish quickly with your fire extinguisher. Fortunately, there is plenty enough fire retardant left
            inside to extinguish another fire if needed.</p>
        <p>You grab a portable communication device and set it to the emergency frequency. You send out a mayday message, which you know will be
            broadcasted to any ships within range, but it will also be fed through the ship's communication module and sent back to command.
        </p>
        <p>Now that your emergency broadcast has been sent, you need to try and save the habitat module and the other crew members in the secondary
            cryo module.
